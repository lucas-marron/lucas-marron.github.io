I am a dual Ph.D student in Economics and Business Real Estate/Land Economics at the University of Wisconsin. My research interests are focused on education, place based policies, and affordable housing. I grew up in Oregon and am a proud alumni and Duck fan. I enjoy backpacking, skiing, and going to college football games.

I am a dual Ph.D. student in Economics and Business (Real Estate/Urban Economics) at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, entering with the 2024 cohort. My research interests lie in urban and public economics, with a focus on education, place-based policy, and affordable housing. Prior to UW–Madison, I was a predoctoral fellow at Yale University, working with Professors Joseph Altonji and John Eric Humphries. Originally from Oregon, I’m a proud University of Oregon alumnus—Go Ducks! In my free time, I enjoy backpacking, biking, running, and traveling.
